# TypeScript Starter Kit

A robust starter kit for TypeScript projects featuring code formatting, linting, automated releases, changelogs, and more.

## Features

- Code Formatting: Consistent code style across your project.
- Linting: Catch common errors and enforce best practices.
- Automated Releases: Seamless versioning and changelog generation.
- Changelogs: Automatically generated changelogs with each release.

## GitHub Actions Workflow: Create Release with Changelog

`github actions` is designed to create a release and generate a changelog using semantic-release. The workflow is manually triggered via the workflow_dispatch event, meaning it won't run automatically but instead must be triggered by a user through the GitHub Actions interface.
